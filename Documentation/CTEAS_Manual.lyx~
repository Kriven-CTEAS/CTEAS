\begin_layout Section*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Coefficient of Thermal Expansion Analysis Suite (CTEAS) is an aid for
 determining the thermal expansion of a material.
 A series of heating and cooling X-ray diffraction patterns can be analyzed
 using Rietveld refinement in a program such as JADE or GSAS and the resulting
 hkl values and spacings can be used as an input for CTEAS.
 CTEAS takes this input and fits a quadratic curve to the lattice parameters
 contained in the input.
 It then forms a rank two thermal expansion tensor, based on crystal symmetry
 for a range of temperatures.
 Using these tensors, thermal expansion is characterized in three dimensions
 of crystallographic space.
 CTEAS allows the user to specify various output options including spreadsheet
 data, two- or three-dimensional plots of thermal expansion, and movies
 of the expansion over a range of temperatures.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Installation and Setup
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The installation of CTEAS is straightforward.
 Two supporting programs are needed: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
2009 NI Run-Time Libraries 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Matlab (2007 and later) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With Matlab and the NI Run-Time Libraries installed, the CTEAS executable
 file can run.
 A set of Matlab function files is included with the executable that must
 be kept in an easily-located area of the computer filesystem.
 These Matlab function files form the backbone of the CTEAS program.
 They can also be used independently from the CTEAS graphical user interface
 (GUI) to perform analyses in Matlab without the use of LabView Run-Time
 Libraries.
 It is much more difficult and time-consuming to perform an analysis this
 way, but other specialized options can be thought of and implemented between
 analysis steps in Matlab.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
How to Use CTEAS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
CTEAS is divided into a three-step tabbed interface.
 The content of each tab relates to the functions of the program that are
 applicable at that stage during operation.
 A green light in the bottom right corner of each tab will signal that the
 user is ready to proceed to the next step.
 The following sections describe the operation of the program during each
 step and a basic operation flow.

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Pre-Run Path Configuration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
CTEAS requires the location of the supporting Matlab function files to be
 specified.
 It also requires a folder containing the input files to be specified.
 The following steps must be taken to ensure the correct operation of the
 program:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Click on the file icon beside the text box under 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

CTERun Directory.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Navigate to the CTERun_vxx directory, navigate inside the directory, then
 click the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Choose Folder
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 button.
 Note that CTERun_vxx denotes the latest version of CTERun.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Click on the file icon beside the text box under 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

File Directory Path.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Navigate to the folder containing the files to be analyzed, navigate inside
 the directory, then click the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Choose Folder
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 button.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Note that the files to be analyzed must all contain the same naming convention.
 Specify a portion of that naming convention that applies to all files to
 be analyzed in the text box under 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Filename String.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 In the example in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:CTEAS-GUI-Step1"

\end_inset

, the Filename String text box contains HfO2Stand, which is common to all
 files listed in the file window.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Specify a room temperature Platinum lattice constant in the box below 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

RT Platinum Lattice Constant
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 if applicable.
 This is optional and only used if Platinum peaks have been used to determine
 temperature for analysis.
 Note that this can be any value for loading files and the temperatures
 can be manually changed if incorrect.
 A second method of temperature correction will be described later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
File Support and Formatting Custom Files
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
CTEAS is configured to read output from MDI JADE 9.
 If analyses were not performed in MDI JADE 9, a custom input file can be
 created.
 Refer to the example input file included in Appendix ___ as a guide for
 creating this custom input file.
 This input file can be created in a text editor or spreadsheet editor for
 user comfort.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Loading Files
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the steps for Pre-Run Path Configuration have been correctly followed
 and either JADE or custom files are located in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

File Directory Path
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 location, the Load Files button can be clicked.
 CTEAS will then locate all files containing the filename string specified
 in step 5 above and list them in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Temperature Data
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 area.
 A green light will turn on in the bottom right of the interface, signifying
 that data have been loaded and values have been saved.
 It is then up to the user to decide whether the displayed temperature values
 are correct before proceeding to Step 2: Run Setup.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Temperature Options
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
CTEAS can only output thermal expansion correctly if temperature is input
 correctly.
 There are three methods for determining or inputting temperatures in CTEAS
 once files are read.
 If Platinum peaks are being used to determine temperature, the Get RT Plat.
 Const.
 button will automatically adjust the temperatures using the room temperature
 Platinum lattice constant contained in the input files.
 Adjustment of this value can also be performed using the input box on the
 left of the screen, titled 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

RT Platinum Lattice Constant.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 The user can also manually edit values by double-clicking on incorrect
 values in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Temperature Data
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 window and writing new values.
 During this editing period, the green light will turn off, letting the
 user know that the program is not ready to proceed anymore.
 Once all desired new values are set manually, click the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Manual Temp Edit
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 button and the green light will appear lit again.
 This signifies being able to proceed to Step 2: Run Setup.

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Choosing a Detected Phase
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Step 2 centers around correctly setting up an analysis and choosing a phase
 contained within the input files.
 An input file can contain multiple phases and materials, leaving the user
 to decide which phase and material to analyze.
 The following steps should be followed for desired operation of CTEAS:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Click on the drop-down arrow beside the box under 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Phase to be Analyzed
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and select a material and phase for analysis.
 The Crystal Symmetry box will be automatically set for the corresponding
 symmetry.
 If this symmetry is undesirable (instantaneous strain calculations, etc),
 check the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Symmetry Override
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 box and select a new symmetry.
 This is for advanced use of the CTEAS program.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Specify a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Polynomial Fit Order.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 The polynomial fit order (usually 2) specifies the order of the polynomial
 used to fit the lattice parameters for calculation of thermal expansion
 coefficients.
 If a straight line is given while using an order of 2, use 3 instead.
 Any other values of the polynomial fit order are not recommended.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If a specified phase is considered in rhombohedral symmetry, a special case
 can be triggered using the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

IN CASE OF RHOMBOHEDRAL
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 box.
 This special case will analyze a phase as a true rhombohedral symmetry
 rather than triclinic.
 Limited functionality is available in Step 3 for this case because of the
 orientation correction applied to the thermal expansion tensor that is
 generated for this case.
 It is recommended to analyze a rhombohedral symmetry triclinically for
 comparison with any other phases contained in a material, but left to the
 user's expertise for this special case.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Temperature ranges must be specified for analysis.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Low Temperature
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 may not be more than 50°C lower than the minimum temperature specified
 in the input files.
 For example, if room temperature data (20°C) was taken, the lowest temperature
 that could be entered in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Low Temperature
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 box would be -30.
 Any temperature entered beyond this bound will result in a coefficient
 of thermal expansion matrix of zeroes.
 An upper bound of 50°C is placed on the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

High Temperature
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as well to ensure that the analysis does not extrapolate too far beyond
 collected data.
 It is recommended that 
\begin_inset Formula $(HighT-LowT)/\Delta T$
\end_inset

 is a whole number for later analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Temperature Step
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 box determines the 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta T$
\end_inset

 for analysis.
 A temperature step of 25 will calculate a coefficient of thermal expansion
 matrix for every 25°C within the low and high temperature range.
 It is recommended that 
\begin_inset Formula $100/\Delta T$
\end_inset

 is equal to a whole number for later analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Once Steps 1-5 have been completed, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Run Analysis
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 button can be pressed.
 This may take some time for the analysis to run, but once it has completed,
 the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Results Ready
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 light will turn on.
 This signifies that Step 2: Analyze Data has been completed and that the
 user can proceed to the final step.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Viewing Lattice Parameters
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At any time after selecting a phase to be analyzed, the user can view and
 save lattice parameters.
 The lattice parameters will be saved to the same folder containing the
 input files as a comma separated variable (.csv) file.
 There is no need to include the file extension while specifying a filename.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The lattice parameters can also be plotted directly from the interface by
 checking the boxes corresponding to which parameters the user wishes to
 view and clicking the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

View Crystal Lattice Parameters
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 button.
 Note that two separate graphs may appear that contain the a,b, and c and
 alpha, beta, and gamma parameters respectively.
 The example in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:CTEAS-GUI-Step2"

\end_inset

 shows just the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

b
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 parameter checked.
 This will produce a single graph with the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

b
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 lattice parameter plotted.
 Note that these parameters are the actual lattice parameters parsed from
 the input files.
 Later versions of CTEAS may include support for viewing the polynomial
 fits alongside the lattice parameters, but this is not implemented as of
 this publication.

\begin_layout Standard
The function of Step 3: Results is to allow the user to view and save a
 variety of methods for displaying the thermal expansion of a chosen material
 and phase.
 The following list will detail what each option means:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Make Movie
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A movie of a thermal expansion ellipsoid can be created and saved.
 This movie shows the change of the thermal expansion ellipsoid over the
 range of temperatures from Step 2: Analyze Data.
 Note that there is a 5-second 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

freeze
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 at the end of the temperature range to allow a still frame for description
 during a presentation (some older movie softwares go to a black screen
 when the movie is complete, thus a 5 second 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pause
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 allows the presenter to have a picture for a few seconds longer).
 The movie file name can be user-specified (once again, the extension is
 not needed) and the movie will be saved in the same directory as the input
 files.
 Creating a movie will output an uncompressed .avi file.
 The size of the file can be very large depending on the size (in pixels)
 that is chosen for the movie/figure output.
 It is recommended that a 640x480 movie be generated, but larger movies
 may be generated and transcoded with editing software should they be necessary.
